    <h2 style="background-color: crimson">Distopia</h2>
    <p>The term "dystopia" refers to an imaginary or speculative society or world that is characterized by oppressive or undesirable conditions, often portraying a grim, bleak, or dehumanizing future. It is the opposite of a utopia, which represents an ideal or perfect society. In a dystopian setting, there are typically totalitarian governments, social and economic inequality, restricted personal freedoms, and a sense of hopelessness or despair.</p>
